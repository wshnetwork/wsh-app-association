        <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good
            and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
            as follows:</p>

        <h2>ARTICLE I - Acceptance of Terms</h2>

                THE APP IN ANY MANNER, YOU (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS AGREEMENT; (B)
                REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (C) ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND
                AGREE THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS
                OR USE THE APP.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.02 AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY</h3>
        <p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity, you
            represent and warrant that you have the full legal authority to bind such entity to this Agreement. In such
            an event, "User" and "you" shall refer to such entity.</p>

        <h3>1.03 INCORPORATION OF PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>The Company's Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. The User acknowledges
            that they have reviewed and consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>ARTICLE II - The App</h2>

        <h3>2.01 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h3>
        <p>The App provides a private, authenticated social platform for university-affiliated communities. The Company
            is an independent entity and is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or otherwise connected to any educational
            institution. Content and views expressed within the App are those of the Users and do not represent the
            views of the Company or any affiliated university.</p>

        <h3>2.02 VERIFICATION</h3>
        <p>Certain features of the App may require verification of the User's affiliation with an educational
            institution. While the Company employs various methods to verify such affiliation, it does not guarantee
            that all Users within a specific community are current students or affiliates of the respective institution.
        </p>

        <h2>ARTICLE III - User Accounts</h2>

        <h3>3.01 ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h3>

            as requested, including, but not limited to, a valid email address and phone number. The User agrees to
            maintain and promptly update all Account information to ensure it remains current and accurate.</p>

        <h3>3.02 ACCOUNT SECURITY</h3>
        <p>The User is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Account credentials, including
            any password or other access information. All activities that occur under the User's Account are the sole
            responsibility of the User. The Company disclaims all liability for any loss or damage arising from
            unauthorized use of a User's Account. The User shall immediately notify the Company in writing of any
            suspected or actual unauthorized use of their Account or any other breach of security.</p>

        <h3>3.03 ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP</h3>
        <p>The individual who creates the Account is the "Account Owner." If the Account is created on behalf of an
            entity, the entity shall be the Account Owner. The Account is non-transferable.</p>

        <h3>4.02 USER RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
        <p>The User is solely responsible for all User-Generated Content originating from their Account. The Company
            acts as a passive conduit for the distribution of User-Generated Content and does not create, endorse, or
            assume any responsibility for it. The Company reserves the right, but not the obligation, to monitor,
            review, and remove User-Generated Content at its sole discretion.</p>

        <p>By making any User-Generated Content available through the App, the User grants the Company a worldwide,
            perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to
            use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, and otherwise exploit such User-Generated Content in

            music, sounds, images, software, videos, designs, trademarks, logos, and other content (collectively,
            "Proprietary Material") that Users see or read through the App is owned by the Company, excluding
            User-Generated Content. Proprietary Material is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual
            property laws. The User shall not copy, download, use, redesign, reconfigure, or retransmit anything from

        <p>The User may submit comments, ideas, or feedback about the App ("Feedback"). By submitting any Feedback, the
            User agrees that their disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place the

        <h2>ARTICLE XIII - General Provisions</h2>

        <h3>13.01 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
        <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the User and the

        <h3>13.05 WAIVER</h3>
        <p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
            other term, and the Company's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not
            constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this Agreement,
