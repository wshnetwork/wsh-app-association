        <ul>

            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We maintain strict access controls to ensure that only authorized
                personnel can access personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong> We conduct periodic security assessments to identify and
                address potential vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breach Response:</strong> In the event of a data breach that poses a risk to your rights

        </ul>

        <h2>ARTICLE X - Automated Decision-Making</h2>
        <p>We use automated tools to assist in content moderation; however, all significant moderation decisions that
            result in account restrictions or content removal are subject to human review. We do not use automated
            decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you.</p>

        <h2>ARTICLE XI - Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make significant changes, we will notify you
            through an in-app notification or by email. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will indicate
            when the latest changes were made.</p>

        <h2>ARTICLE XII - International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than your country of residence.
            These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country. Specifically, our
            servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and service providers operate around the
            world.</p>
        <p>When we transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure that it receives an
            adequate level of protection. Where applicable, we rely on the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework for transfers
            to certified organizations in the United States, and on the European Commission's Standard Contractual
            Clauses (SCCs) for other international transfers. These mechanisms require all recipients to protect
            personal data in accordance with EU data protection law.</p>

        <h2>ARTICLE XIII - Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Platform is intended for users aged 18 and over. Individuals under 18 are not permitted to use the
            Platform. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware
            that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps
            to remove that information from our servers.</p>
