        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>

        <h2>How reporting works</h2>
        <p>If you see content that breaks these rules, tap the flag icon to report it. Campus moderators and WSH staff
            review reports and take action. Repeat or severe violations can lead to temporary or permanent loss of WSH
            access. These guidelines evolve as WSH grows.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Harassment, Personal Attacks, and Doxing</h2>
        <p>Do not use WSH to endanger, intimidate, or target an individual or group.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not post or solicit private information about anyone, including names used to shame, phone numbers,
                addresses, whereabouts, or any data that could identify a student without consent.</li>
            <li>Content using a student's identifiable info in a negative or mean-spirited way is removed.</li>
            <li>Newsworthy discussion about events is allowed only when verifiably public and without doxing.</li>
            <li>Faculty and staff are not students and can therefore be mentioned by name. Group names can be used,
                provided the post doesn't include personal information about an individual member. Individual students
                however cannot be targeted.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Attack ideas, not people. Never share someone's private info.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Hate Speech</h2>
        <p>No bigotry or dehumanizing content toward any protected characteristic, including race, ethnicity, national
            origin, caste, religion, disability, serious disease, age, body type, gender, gender identity, or sexual
            orientation. Applies to everyone, including public figures and staff.</p>

        <p>Absolutely no jokes about sexual assault, no minimization of survivors' experiences, and no victim-blaming.
            Sharing resources, asking for support, and discussing policy or prevention is allowed when respectful and
            non-graphic.</p>

                students or staff are strictly prohibited.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">

        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Self-Harm</h2>
        <p>Supportive discussion of mental health is welcome, but anything that encourages, instructs, glorifies, or
            jokes about self-harm or suicide is removed.</p>
        <p>If you or someone you know is in immediate danger in the EU, call 112. In France, you can call 15 for medical
            emergencies. For suicide prevention support in France, call 3114 for 24/7 professional help.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Illegal Activity</h2>
        <p>Discussion about alcohol, weed, or drugs may occur in university contexts, but buying, selling, or

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Spoilers</h2>
        <p>Revealing key plot points or endings without warning is not allowed. If you discuss spoilers, start your post
            with "Spoiler: [Title]".</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> No one likes a spoiler, label spoilers so others can enjoy content
                unspoiled.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">✅</span>Promotions and Advertising, With Limits</h2>
        <p>WSH is a student community, not an ad board.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allowed: school-related events, student clubs, or harmless personal listings that clearly benefit your
                campus.</li>
            <li>Prohibited unless approved: brand, event, or service promotions.</li>
            <li>To inquire about approved advertising, email contact@wshnetwork.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> If it helps your campus, it is likely okay. Ads need approval.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Harassing or Impersonating Moderators</h2>
        <p>Moderators are here to keep WSH safe. Do not harass, dox, or impersonate them. Appeals should be made
            respectfully through in-app reporting or contact@wshnetwork.com.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Respect moderators and the process.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">❌</span>Images & Privacy</h2>
        <p>Do not post identifiable photos or videos of other students without their consent. Photos of public events
            are allowed, but never if they single out a private individual in a harmful way.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Respect people's right to privacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">⚠️</span>Meetups & Safety</h2>
        <p>If you use WSH to organize meetups, events, or parties, remember to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet in public or safe locations.</li>
            <li>Never pressure anyone to attend.</li>
            <li>Do not post event details that could endanger others (e.g., private addresses without consent).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Keep meetups safe, consensual, and respectful.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">🚨</span>Moderation</h2>
        <p>Moderation on WSH exists to protect student communities and maintain a safe, engaging platform.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Moderation system:</strong> Most content review is handled by the WSH internal team. WSH uses
                professional tools to support our moderation system and an unbiased application of the rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Student Moderators:</strong> Each campus community has a small team of student moderators. They
                provide context for reports and help ensure that posts align with the guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Moderators do not have access to user identities. They use the same app
                as every other student but have the ability to vote on whether reported posts violate the rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> No single moderator can remove content. Posts are only taken down
                through majority vote. The WSH team reviews moderation regularly to ensure fairness and adherence to the
                guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply to Moderate:</strong> Students interested in helping their campus community can apply by
                emailing moderation@wshnetwork.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Moderation is shared, transparent, and overseen by both students and WSH
                staff.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">🚨</span>Accountability</h2>
        <p>To maintain a safe, respectful, and engaging environment, WSH applies a range of consequences when users
            break the rules. The goal is not to punish, but to protect the community and ensure the best possible
            experience for all students.</p>

        <h3>Types of Consequences</h3>

        <h3>⚠️ Warning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A written notice, usually sent by email, explaining the violation and reminding the user of the
                guidelines.</li>
            <li>Issued for first-time or minor infractions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔇 Muting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporary restriction that prevents the user from posting, commenting, or quoting.</li>
            <li>Muted users can still upvote, downvote, and participate in polls.</li>
            <li>Duration depends on the violation: 12 hours, 24 hours, 48–72 hours, 1 week, 1 month</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🚫 Permanent Ban</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Full removal of access to WSH.</li>
            <li>Reserved for the most severe or repeated violations.</li>
            <li>Appeals may be considered. In rare cases, banned users may regain restricted access (permanently muted,
                read-only).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⚖️ How Enforcement Decisions Are Made</h3>
        <p>Enforcement on WSH is not automatic. Each case is reviewed with context in mind, and actions are based on
            several factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of the Violation:</strong> The more serious the breach (e.g., hate speech, threats of
                violence, doxing, sexual assault jokes), the faster and stricter the response.</li>
            <li><strong>Frequency of Violations:</strong> Repeated infractions, even if small on their own, add up and
                lead to stronger consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Timing of Violations:</strong> Multiple posts breaking the rules in a short span may result in
                quicker restrictions to stop disruption.</li>
            <li><strong>Context and Impact:</strong> Moderators and the WSH team look at intent and the effect of the
                post before making a final decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Consequences match the severity and pattern of behavior. The aim is to
                protect the community, not punish individuals.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">🌐</span>Affiliation & Updates</h2>
        <p>WSH is an independent platform and is not connected to or endorsed by any educational institution. The
            opinions and content shared by users reflect their own views, not those of WSH or any school.</p>
        <p>These guidelines are a living document. As WSH grows, we will continue to update and refine them to best
            support safe and respectful student communities.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">🚩</span>Reporting & Appeals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> If you see content that breaks the rules, tap the flag icon on the post or
                comment to report it. Reports are reviewed by moderators and the WSH team.</li>
            <li><strong>Urgent Safety Risks:</strong> If someone is in immediate danger, always contact local emergency
                services first.</li>
            <li><strong>Appeals & Questions:</strong> If you have concerns about a moderation decision or want to
                appeal, email contact@wshnetwork.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>General rule:</strong> Use in-app reporting for rule violations, and email us if you need help
                with moderation decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-emoji">🌍</span>Language Support</h2>
        <p>WSH supports moderation in the following languages:</p>
        <p>English, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Thai, Hindi, Japanese, Chinese,
            Korean, Punjabi, and Turkish.</p>
        <p>This means content posted in these languages will be reviewed and moderated according to our community
            guidelines.</p>
